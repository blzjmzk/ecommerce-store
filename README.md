# E-commerce Project (2/2): Online store

This is part of my e-commerce project where I build from scratch an e-commerce platform in two parts: (1) Dashboard and backend to support multiple shops that can be connected to it, (2) Online shop connected to dashboard and backend.

Here is the shop connected to dashboard and backend. You can find fist part of my E-commerce project (the dashboard and backend itself) here:
